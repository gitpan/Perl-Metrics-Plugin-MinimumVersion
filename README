NAME
    Perl::Metrics::Plugin::MinimumVersion - Perl::Metrics plugin for
    Perl::MinimumVersion

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Perl::Metrics "plugin" that generated the two primary metrics
    generated by the Perl::MinimumVersion module. These are the minimum
    explicit perl version dependency, and the minimum syntax perl version
    dependency.

    While this is an actual plugin to be used to real purposes, it provides
    a suitable example of a simple plugin which brings functionality from a
    PPI-based module into the larger Perl::Metrics framework.

    In addition, because the results could change based on changes to
    Perl::MinimumVersion this module also demonstrates the user of
    "versioned" metrics.

    The "metrics" method is overloaded to return an explicit list of
    metrics, with the appropriate metric versions based on the version of
    Perl::MinimumVersion.

METHODS
  metric_explicit
    Provides the metric 'explicit', the minimum explicit version provided as
    a normalized and serialized version object.

  metric_syntax
    Provides the metric 'syntax', the minimum explicit version provided as a
    normalized and serialized version object.
